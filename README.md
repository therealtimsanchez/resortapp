This repository contains the code from the chapter 4 example of Ionic in Action. It is an app for a resort that guests could use to learn about their reservation, local restaurants, and current weather.

Here are the primary things we do in this chapter.

* Setup navigation with history
* Use the slide box, used as an app intro
* Load data from external APIs using loading indicators
* Setup and use infinite scrolling
* Use Ionic's icon set Ionicons
* Use Ionic cards and lists

# I actually changed this app from Hawaii to Florida and made sure to add some directions in there from different place
I also added a filter, which is a compass to represent the directions
I also made sure to change the background color and made sure to shake it up a little
I took some pointers from various websites and took some documentation from ionic itself
